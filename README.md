# House-Pricing-Predictions-Feature-Engineering
 The goal of this notebook is to perform a thoughtful, end-to-end feature engineering process on the Ames House Prices dataset. The focus is not on model accuracy but on the justification and reasoning behind each data cleaning, transformation, and creation decision. The final output will be a dataset ready for predictive modeling.
